Question 5. You own a software company that supports audits done by civil and mechanical engineers. The software has originally been sold to private and municipal organizations that monitor buildings and infrastructure (bridges, roads, etc). You would like to integrate Evernote into your product. The hope is that Evernote will provide improved note-taking and appointment functionality.
Set up your JIRA project created in step 4 to assist with this change. Ensure that your project follows conventions found in the text.
You should do the following: develop a sample persona, at least two scenarios and associated user stories for your potential product.
* Backlog. Create a list of items that should be tackled. At this point, there is no need to include implementation items.
* Sprint. Use the backlog to create your first sprint. 


Answer:
Scenario 2: Readily accessible on any device and appointment management


Merry is a civil engineer at ABC Infra Solutions who is tasked with inspection of bridges in the city. This requires her to travel to various sites for work. She is married and has two children, both of whom go to school. This makes managing personal and professional life challenging since she needs to travel to different destinations in the city for work. Keeping track of all her appointments is a task that needs simplification. There is a need for in-app and email reminders to make sure she does not miss any scheduled appointments. In addition, she needs to check off appointments that are done or reschedule if there are complications. Notifications for deadlines is another feature that would make Merryâ€™s work easier. 
Most times she carries her laptop to the inspections for note making but it is not feasible for some of the locations which means she has to make do with her mobile phone. Sometimes she also needs to quickly jot down points or scan things, regarding inspections for later reference, which are difficult to keep organised and thus possess as a challenge when making the final report. So a feature that enables linking these notes and scans to the respective appointment would be a great help for her work.
